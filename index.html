          <h1>Hi, I'm <span>Phoebe Nortey</span></h1>
          <p>
            I'm a Biomedical Engineering student driven by a passion for
            innovation in healthcare technology. <br />I am particularly
            interested in how artificial intelligence and digital advancements
            can transform medical diagnostics, patient care, and treatment
            strategies. <br />Through continuous learning and research, I aspire
            to contribute to the development of smarter, more efficient
            healthcare solutions. <br />This profile website serves as a
            reflection of my journey, highlighting my academic pursuits,
            personal interests, and professional aspirations. Beyond my studies,
            I have a deep love for reading, exploring AI applications in
            medicine, and designing meaningful solutions that have a positive
            impact on people's lives
